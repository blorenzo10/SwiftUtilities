# Swift Utilities
A list with some of the Swift Utilities that I use in my work day as an iOS developer

I have separate into 3 categories: UIKit, SwiftUI and Common (for those that you can use with UIKit and SwiftUI as well)

### Common
- [Fonts](https://github.com/blorenzo10/SwiftUtilities/blob/master/Common%20/Fonts.swift "Fonts")

### UIKit
- [Constraints](https://github.com/blorenzo10/SwiftUtilities/blob/master/UIKit/Constraints.swift "Constraints")
